# Online Doctor Appointment Booking System
This project is a web-based system designed to streamline the process of booking medical appointments online. Built with HTML, internal CSS, and JavaScript, the application provides a user-friendly interface for patients to easily schedule consultations with doctors.

The application begins with a welcoming home page, which acts as the entry point to the system. From there, users are guided through a registration (sign-up) page, where they can create a new account by entering their personal details. Existing users can access the login page to sign in securely. Once authenticated, users are directed to the main appointment interface, where they can select doctors, choose available time slots, and confirm their bookings.

The layout is styled using internal CSS to provide a clean and accessible interface. JavaScript is used for basic interactivity such as form handling and navigation. Though this version doesn’t connect to a backend or store persistent data, it demonstrates core concepts of a real-world medical booking system—like page-to-page navigation, structured input forms, and conditional access.

This project is ideal for showcasing foundational frontend skills in a functional healthcare-related context. It’s especially useful for students or early-career developers building a portfolio of practical web applications.

The project is Git-tracked and ready for deployment via GitHub Pages, allowing live previews and sharing. It serves as a solid base for future enhancements such as backend integration, database storage, and responsive design.
